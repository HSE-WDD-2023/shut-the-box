# Shut the Box Dice Game
The following rules represent the most standard or traditional version of the game, but there are many, many variations to allow you to alter the game if you should choose.

Set the markers in the center of the table so they can be easily accessed by all players. Choose a starting player and give them the two dice. After the first player completes their turn, play will progress clockwise around the table.

## Important terminology: 
Each box on the board that contains a number is called a number-space. When you cover a number-space with a marker, you have “shut” that number-space. If a player is able to cover all nine number-spaces on their turn, they have “shut the box” and they score 0 points for that turn (which is a good thing!).

## Game Play 
To begin your turn, place the empty board in front of you and roll the two dice. You may then take one of the following two actions:

#### Use each die individually
* If the numbers on the two dice are different from each other, and if both number-spaces on the board that match the numbers on the dice are not currently shut, then you may shut each of those number-spaces.

#### Use the sum of both dice
* If the number-space that matches the sum of the two dice is not currently shut, you may shut that number-space.

If you are able to perform one of these two actions, you may then continue your turn by rolling both dice again. If you were unable to perform either action, then your turn is over.

## Scoring
At the end of your turn, sum up all the number-spaces that have not been shut. Record that result. Keep a running total of each player's score.

If you succeed in shutting number-spaces 7, 8, and 9 on your turn, and your turn has not ended, you have the option of rolling only a single die instead of both dice. If you do roll a single die and the number-space matching the number you rolled is shut, then your turn ends.

Play continues for five rounds so that each player will get five turns in total, and then a winner is determined. (See Winning Shut the Box below.)

###Example:

On the first throw of your turn, you roll a 3 and a 5. You decide to use the sum of both dice and so you shut the “8” number-space. Since you were able to perform one of the two turn actions, you roll the dice again. This time you get a 5 and a 6. The sum of 5 + 6 is 11, and since there is no “11” number-space, you have to place one marker in the “5” number-space and one marker in the “6” number-space. You roll the dice a third time, and this time you get a 1 and a 5. You are unable to use both dice individually, because the “5” number-space is already shut, and you can't use the sum of the two dice since the “6” number-space is also already shut. This ends your turn and so you clear the board and pass it and the dice to the next player.

Winning Shut the Box
The player with the lowest total score at the end of five rounds is the winner.
